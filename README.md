# EEP 153 Project 2
For our group, Sylvia Lane, we have decided to research and base our project around keto diets versus unrestricted diets among people living in the Bay Area. This topic was compelling because keto originated as a treatment for those who suffer from seizures, and the diet is quite expensive to keep up with, especially so when finding food around the Bay Area since the cost of living is high. 
Keto restricts those on the diet from eating more than 5-10% carbohydrates, and the main proportion of the diet is around 70% fats. 
We hope you enjoy our project!
